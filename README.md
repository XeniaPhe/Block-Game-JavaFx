# Block-Game-JavaFx
Blockie is the game that I and my friend (mostly I) coded with java-fx as our term project in my second term of the uni.
It's a simple game with pretty simple rules:
-There are 4 types of blocks 2 of them being destroyable.
-There's a 10x10 grid where the blocks will go into
-Levels are loaded into the scene as you pass them(You can also generate random levels)
-When you click on a block,the block and neighbouring blocks will be degraded to one lower level and player gets a score from every valid click depending on the count of the blocks degraded(can be a negative score too)
-The level is passed when there are no destroyable(degradable) blocks left
-The purpose of the player must be to pass the levels with as highest score as possible!
